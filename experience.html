      <h2>Experiences</h2>
      <p>Originally coding was seen as something unreachable because it was so hard to understand but I told myself to
        keep my head down and eventually I started to understand concepts. </p>
      <p>Every few days there is a wow moment or a light bulb moment üí° that gets me excited to continue coding.</p>
      <p>The
        web is super big and I know that I wont know everything but the fact that I will always be learning new things
        is very exciting. I am looking forward to building amazing looking websites and web apps.</p>
      <p>I am a lover of different foods and great at making pizza's üçï. I love learning new things and I believe there
        are
        many ways or variations in order to grasp a concept</p>
