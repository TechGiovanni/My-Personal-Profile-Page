# My-Personal-Profile-Page
 For my first project, Iâ€™ll practice web design skills by customizing a web page to create a personal profile. I'll modify the code for a basic web page by adding graphics, custom text, and a stylish design. This is a great way for me to practice HTML and CSS skills. It also gives me a web page I can use as a personal online calling card to advertise my experience, skills, and goals, and to provide links to my social media accounts on LinkedIn and GitHub. I'll also practice using GitHub, which is an important tool used by developers to share code and work collaboratively on programming projects. Creating and using a GitHub account is also a great way to share my work with potential employers.
